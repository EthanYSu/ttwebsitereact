              Rush allows you to learn more about Theta Tau and what we have to
              offer. There will be several events that shows you what our
              fraternity is about and gives you a chance to meet our active
              members. Rush is free and isn't a requirement but it will give a
              better opportunity to learn about the fraternity and increase your
              chances of receiving a bid.

              No you don't! However, it will help us get to know you more and
              make you stand out. We understand that it's difficult to attend
              every single rush event because of school and other time
              commitments. We highly recommend you show up to as many events as
              possible and reserve an interview slot! If you can't make it to
              any event please make sure to email us at ucsbthetatau@gmail.com
              and explain to us your situation!
